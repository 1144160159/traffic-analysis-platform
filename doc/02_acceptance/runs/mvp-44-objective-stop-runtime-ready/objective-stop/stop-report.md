- run_id: `mvp-44-objective-stop-runtime-ready`
- status: `OBJECTIVE_STOP_CONTINUE`
- recommendation: `continue_loop`
- objective: `complete_project_development`
- required_tasks: `12`
- open_required_tasks: `12`
- release_status: `RELEASE_FROZEN`

## Findings
- `pending` `REQUIRED_TASKS_OPEN` `scripts/codex_loop/tasks`: 10 required P0 tasks are not terminal. Recommendation: Continue task execution until each required task has closure evidence.
- `pending` `REQUIRED_TASKS_OPEN` `scripts/codex_loop/tasks`: 2 required P1 tasks are not terminal. Recommendation: Continue task execution until each required task has closure evidence.

## Rule
- READY is the only success stop condition.
- CONTINUE means the loop should keep working within normal budgets.
- BLOCKED and HUMAN_GATE are stop conditions for repair or human decision, not success.
