# Architecture Evolution: CLE-P0-REVIEWER-001

- run_id: `mvp-35-workflow-model-profile`
- task: 开启第三视角 Reviewer Gate
- priority: `P0`
- status: `DISCOVERED`
- primary_lane: `Mission / Acceptance`
- dependent_lanes: Product Design
- acceptance_type: `regression`

## Evolution Principle
- Evolve one contract boundary at a time and keep each step reversible or compatibility-preserving.
- Put product behavior, API contract, data sensitivity and verification gate in writing before code changes.
- Treat this package as design evidence, not as implementation evidence.

## Recommended Architecture Step
- Keep this as a design-prep package; select a narrower implementation task before changing code.

## Dependency Signals
- `apisix_routes` impacts: CLE-P0-ROUTE-001, CLE-P0-SEC-001
- `database_schema` impacts: CLE-P0-DLQ-001, CLE-P0-P95-001, CLE-P0-PCAP-001
- `kafka_topics` impacts: CLE-P0-DLQ-001, CLE-P0-SEC-001
- `proto` impacts: CLE-P0-DLQ-001, CLE-P0-P95-001, CLE-P0-PCAP-001

## Architecture Stop Conditions
- Do not close the task from this package alone.
- Keep smoke, regression, acceptance and third-party evidence as separate evidence layers.
- Prefer existing repository contracts and UI documents over newly invented behavior.
