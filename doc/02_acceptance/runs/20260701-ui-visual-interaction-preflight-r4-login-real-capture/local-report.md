- React page components present: 28/28
- Visual diff evidence passed: 0/30
- Business interaction evidence passed: 1/28
- Full-page design-image reference blockers: 0
- Desktop Chrome status: `pass`
- Matrix: `doc/02_acceptance/runs/20260701-ui-visual-interaction-preflight-r4-login-real-capture/ui-visual-interaction-matrix.json`

This gate is intentionally stricter than the UI contract gate. Passing the contract proves route/API/page structure; it does not prove that the real frontend visually matches the generated UI references 1:1.

## Blockers
- `visual-diff` every visual target has passing 1920x1080 screenshot diff evidence: 30/30 visual targets missing or failing visual diff evidence: login, screen, dashboard, alerts, alert-detail, campaigns, campaign-detail, attack-chains, encrypted-traffic, forensics, assets, graph, fusion, baselines, probes, rules, deployments, models, mlops, data-quality, playbooks, whitelist, compliance, audit-log, notifications, settings, not-found, topics-encrypted-tunnel, topics-data-exfiltration, topics-apt-campaign
- `business-interaction` every route has passing business interaction evidence: 27/28 routes missing or failing business interaction evidence: screen, dashboard, alerts, alert-detail, campaigns, campaign-detail, attack-chains, encrypted-traffic, forensics, assets, graph, fusion, baselines, probes, rules, deployments, models, mlops, data-quality, playbooks, whitelist, compliance, audit-log, notifications, settings, not-found, topics
