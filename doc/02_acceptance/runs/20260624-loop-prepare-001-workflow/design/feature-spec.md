# Feature Spec: CLE-P0-DLQ-001

- run_id: `20260624-loop-prepare-001-workflow`
- task: DLQ replay API、审批、审计、幂等验证
- priority: `P0`
- status: `DISCOVERED`
- primary_lane: `Storage / Data Quality`
- dependent_lanes: Go Control-plane, Proto / Kafka / Flink, Mission / Acceptance
- acceptance_type: `regression`

## Actors
- authenticated operator
- system auditor
- third-view reviewer

## Capability
- Keep this as a design-prep package; select a narrower implementation task before changing code.
- The feature must expose a clear product state for authorized, unauthorized, expired, degraded and empty-data scenarios.
- The frontend must surface loading and error states without fabricating successful business data.

## Functional Requirements
- Keep behavior inside the task's allowed workspace and declared lane.
- Document any change to public UX, API semantics or evidence status before implementation closes.
- Require negative cases for auth, tenant, empty data and degraded upstream dependencies when applicable.

## Acceptance-facing Behavior
- bad message injection path exists
- manual repair, approval, replay and audit are represented
- idempotency key and duplicate-write evidence are recorded
