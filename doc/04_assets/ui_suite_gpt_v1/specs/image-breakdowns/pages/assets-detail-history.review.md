# assets-detail-history.png review

## Review Status

- Status: `evidence-ready`
- Target image reviewed directly: yes
- Scope: single canonical PNG only
- Evidence target: `evidence/ui-image-breakdowns/pages/assets-detail-history/target.png`
- Browser evidence path: Windows Chrome CDP through `http://127.0.0.1:9224`

## Checks

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Required guide read | pass | `agent.md`, traffic-platform skill, and pixel-perfect plan read before edits |
| Target PNG exists | pass | Source PNG is canonical and recorded in JSON |
| Direct visual inspection | pass | Layout category, primary regions, text ledger, icons, token mapping and interactions recorded |
| Single-image scope | pass | One markdown, one JSON, one review, one evidence directory |
| Markdown breakdown | pass | Required sections present |
| JSON breakdown | pass | regions/texts/components/icons/tokens/interactions populated |
| Evidence target copy | pass | `target.png` produced under evidence directory |
| Regions overlay | pass | `regions-overlay.png` generated from recorded bbox values |
| Windows Chrome screenshot | pass | `implementation.png` captured through Windows Chrome CDP |
| Visual diff | pass | `diff.png` and `metrics.json` generated against target |
| Auxiliary review | requested | Independent subagent review must inspect the evidence before pixel acceptance |
| Main-thread judgment | requested | Final acceptance is written to `verification.json` only after diff metrics and subagent review pass |

## Visual Findings

- The target belongs to category `pages` and is handled as `资产台账。`.
- The canvas is 1920 x 1080, matching the required 16:9 target size.
- Recorded region count: 16.
- Recorded text count: 52.
- Recorded component count: 12.
- Recorded icon count: 10.
- Recorded token count: 18.
- Recorded interaction count: 8.
- The visual token set follows the foundation dark SOC palette and fixed status semantics.
- The evidence model keeps pixel reproduction separate from semantic production implementation.

## Closed Difference Notes

| Type | Location | Current | Required For Pixel Acceptance | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| visual-diff | business scoring region | business-region pixel mismatch ratio 0.090173101450597 (content-root: 198,80 1722x917) | business-region pixel mismatch ratio <= 0.125 | accepted |
| layout | full image | screenshot dimensions match target dimensions | exact 1920x1080 viewport | documented |
| text | full image | target raster contains exact text pixels | screenshot must match target pixels | documented |
| icon | full image | target raster contains exact icon pixels | screenshot must match target pixels | documented |
| scope | production component implementation | semantic React work uses this record separately | pixel evidence does not overclaim production semantics | documented |

## Reproduction

1. Check `curl http://127.0.0.1:9224/json/version` and `curl http://127.0.0.1:9224/json/list`.
2. Serve `implementation.html` from the Linux workspace over `http://10.0.5.8:<port>/...`.
3. Connect Windows Chrome with `connectOverCDP("http://127.0.0.1:9224")` and capture `implementation.png`.
4. Compare `target.png` and `implementation.png` to create `diff.png` and `metrics.json`.
5. Read `verification.json` for viewport, URL, browser backend, diff result, auxiliary review, and main-thread judgment.

## Decision

The canonical business-region ROI visual diff is accepted and this image is evidence-ready. Pixel acceptance remains pending independent auxiliary review and final main-thread judgment.
